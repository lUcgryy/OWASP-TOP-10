## **1. Description**

Access control, sometimes called authorization, is how a web application grants access to content and functions to some users and not others. These checks are performed after authentication, and govern what 'authorized' users are allowed to do. Access control sounds like a simple problem but is insidiously difficult to implement correctly. A web applicationâ€™s access control model is closely tied to the content and functions that the site provides. In addition, the users may fall into a number of groups or roles with different abilities or privileges.

Broken access control refers to a security vulnerability that occurs when an application does not properly restrict access to sensitive resources, such as user accounts, data, or functionality. This vulnerability can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, perform actions that should be restricted, or escalate their privileges to gain administrative access

There are some common broken access control vulnerabilities:

-   **Directory traversal**: This vulnerability occurs when an application allows a user to access files and directories that are outside the intended directory.
-  **Local file inclusion (LFI)**: This vulnerability occurs when an application includes local files through user-supplied input. This can be used to read sensitive files on the server, including configuration and source code files.
-   **Remote file inclusion (RFI)**: This vulnerability occurs when an application includes files from remote servers through user-supplied input. This can be used to read sensitive files on the server, including configuration and source code files.
-   **Insecure direct object references (IDOR)**: This vulnerability occurs when an application uses predictable or sequential identifiers to access objects, such as user accounts, files, or database entries.
-   **Privilege escalation**: A user gets access to more resources or functionality than they are normally allowed, and such elevation or changes should have been prevented by the application
-   **Bypassing authorization schema**: Bypassing the restrictions and limitations set by an application's authorization mechanism, such as a user role or access level.

For example, in this [Web Project](./Vuln%20Web/) this php function `include` when not implement correctly, the attacker can retrieve the content of any file on server.

```php
include("/var/www/html/".str_replace("../","",$file));
```
If the attacker send the payload `....//....//....//....//etc/passwd` the function will return the content of the file `/etc/passwd

    ...
    ```

    ```
    GET /api/v1/users/. HTTP/1.1
    Host: example.com
    ...
    ```

## **3. How to fix**

**General**

-   Identify all access control points in your application, including user roles, permissions, and authorization mechanisms.
-   Conduct a security assessment of your application to identify potential vulnerabilities and security gaps in your access control mechanisms.
-   Implement a strong and secure authentication and authorization mechanism, such as OAuth or OpenID Connect, that can handle different user roles and permissions.
-   Use input validation and sanitization to ensure that user input is valid and does not contain malicious code or scripts.
-   Enforce the principle of least privilege by ensuring that users have only the minimum level of access necessary to perform their tasks.
-   Restricting access to all resources or functionality unless theyâ€™re intended to be public.
-   Implement session management mechanisms to control user sessions and prevent unauthorized access.
-   Regularly monitor and audit access logs and user activities to identify any suspicious or unauthorized access attempts.
-   If (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) CORS is enabled, try to limit CORS usage. Ensure that the Access-Control-Allow-Origin header is set to a specific domain or a wildcard, and not set to *.

**Directory Traversal**

- Validate user input: Implement strict input validation to ensure that user-supplied input is within the expected boundaries.

- Implement Access Control: Implement access controls on the server to restrict access to sensitive files and directories

- Sanitize file names: Sanitize user-supplied file names to remove any special characters or path separators that could be used to navigate outside of the web root directory

    Example:

    ```php
    while (strpos($str, '../') !== false) {
        $str = str_replace('../', '', $str);
    }
    ```

- Use whitelisting: Use whitelisting to restrict file access to only known, safe files and directories. 

    Example:

    ```php
    allowed = [list of allowed files]
    if in_array($file, allowed) {
        include("/var/www/html/".$file);
    }
    ```

- Use database: Use a database to store file names and paths, and retrieve the file names and paths from the database when needed.

- Use a secure file handling library: Use a secure file handling library that has been designed to prevent Directory Traversal attacks. 


In the example that is in previous section, the `include` function mentioned in the previous section can be fixed by applying whitelist validation to the input parameter.

```php
allowed = ['about', 'contact', 'home', 'services']
if in_array($file, allowed) {
    include("/var/www/html/".$file);
}
```

**Authorization Schema Bypass**

-   Review the authentication and authorization mechanisms in use:
-   Implement secure coding practices
-   Implement access control checks on both the server and client side
-   Use encryption to secure sensitive data
-   Regularly perform security testing
-   Implement a security monitoring system   

**Privilege Escalation**

-   Review the permissions of users, groups, and other entities that can access the system or its resources
-   Limit user input
-   Audit logs
-   Apply updates and patches
-   Use role-based access control
-   Conduct regular security assessments
-   Implement Multi-Factor Authentication
-   Secure configuration management

**IDOR**

-   Identify the sensitive resources: Identify the sensitive resources in your application that are accessible through direct object references
-   Implement access controls: Implement access controls to restrict access to sensitive resources based on user permissions
-   Use indirect references: Use indirect references instead of direct object references to access sensitive resources. Indirect references could be a lookup table, a mapping function, or any other mechanism that provides an abstraction layer between the user input and the actual resource.

    Example:

    ```php
    // Define a mapping of indexes to object IDs
    $mapping = array(
        1 => 1234,
        2 => 5678,
        3 => 9101
    );

    // Get the index from the URL
    $index = $_GET['index'];

    // Look up the corresponding object ID in the mapping
    $objectId = $mapping[$index];

    // Check if the user is authorized to access the object
    if (isAuthorized($user, $objectId)) {
        // Process the request
    } else {
        // Return an error response
    }
    ```

-   Validate user input: Validate user input to ensure that the user is authorized to access the requested resource. This could be done by checking the user's credentials, session information, or any other relevant data.

## **4. How to bypass**

**Directory traversal**

- Absolute path (`/etc/passwd`)
- Null byte (`../../../../../etc/passwd%00`) (This is only work when the php version is 5.3.4 or lower)
- URL encoding (`%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f%2e%2e%2f/etc/passwd`)
- 16 bits URL encoding

    ```
    . = %u002e
    / = %u2215
    \ = %u2216
    ```
- UTF-8 Unicode encoding 

    ```
    . = %c0%2e, %e0%40%ae, %c0ae
    / = %c0%af, %e0%80%af, %c0%2f
    \ = %c0%5c, %c0%80%5c
    ```

- Double URL encoding (%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252fetc%252fpasswd)
- Start with existen
- Bypass `../` replace by "" non-recursively (`....//` or `..././)
- Bypass `../` with `;` (`..;/`)
- Bypass `../../` check (`.././../`)
- Windows UNC Bypass (`\\localhost\c$\windows\win.ini`)
- NGINX/ALB Bypass

    NGINX in certain configurations and Application LoadBalancer (ALB) can block traversal attacks in the route, For example: http://nginx-server/../../ will return a 400 bad request.

    To bypass this behaviour just add forward slashes in front of the url: http://nginx-server////////../../
- Java Bypass 
    ```
    url:file:///etc/passwd
    url:http://127.0.0.1:8080
    ```

## **5. Tools**

**Directory traversal**
- [Dotdotpwn](https://github.com/wireghoul/dotdotpwn)

    Example Usage:

    ```
    dotdotpwn -m http-url -u http://example.com/index.php?page=TRAVERSAL -o unix -f /etc/passwd -k "root:" -r trick.txt -d 4
    ```
    - `-m` : The module to use. In this case, we are using the http-url module.
    - `-u` : The URL to test. The program will replace the TRAVERSAL string with the traversal patterns string.
    - `-o` : The operating system to use. In this case, we are using the unix operating system.
    - `-f` : The file to retrieve. In this case, we are retrieving the /etc/passwd file.
    - `-k` : The keyword to search for. In this case, we are searching for the root user.
    - `-r` : The file to save the results to. In this case, we are saving the results to the trick.txt file.
    - `-d` : The depth of the traversal. In this case, we are using a depth lower or equal than 4.
    
    After running for a while, we get the result:
